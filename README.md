# automation

This is an automation project based on a smoke-test for an education based website. The initial commits are based on Selenium IDE, and later commits will be exported to a few different code types to make them more digestable. Keep in mind it has been a bit of time since I've used Selenium IDE, so please be gentle with your expectations.

History:
The initial scope was using Cypress, but issues were encountered coming up to speed on the learning and execution side.
Selenium IDE has been used in the past to do functional recordings to be run along-side performance test scripts to calculate web response times during load events.

Scope:
Because this is a smoke test, the scope involved accessing drop-downs on the main page, then navigating to various pages, ending on the login page for Disney. Tests were built on the basis of Clicks with verify commands to ensure the action was occuring.
